An IRC Bot written in Python


Installation
--------------
Have all the files here in the same folder and do:

python slothbot.py

If you want to improve speed, you can compile the files by doing:

python -O -m py_compile <file1> <file2> <file3> <file3> ..

In this case, it would be:

python -O -m py_compile slothbot.py definitions.py variables.py
